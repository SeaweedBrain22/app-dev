# My Favorite Series: *Anne with an E*

> “Isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?”  
> — *Anne Shirley*

**Anne with an E** is my favorite series because it tells a beautiful story about imagination, friendship, and self-discovery. The show follows **Anne Shirley**, an orphan girl with a wild imagination who learns to find belonging and love in the small town of Avonlea. I like how it mixes humor, emotion, and life lessons that relate to real experiences.
